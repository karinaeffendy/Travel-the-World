## General info
* Travel the World is an 'choose your own adventure' based quiz, where users are able to answer questions to create a personalised travel itinerary.
* This project is for users who struggle to find a new country to visits or the indecisive traveller.
* I created this project because I am an avid traveller and I am always wanting to visit new countries but can't always decide where to go. 
	
## Technologies
Project is created with:
* Python 3.14.0
* Visual Studio Code
* Tkinter

## Setup
* To run this project, you will need to have Visual Studio Code downloaded

## Project Status 
Completed for the assessment. Can still be developed further. 

## Room For Improvement
Challenge:
* Within the project I had struggled with figuring how the basis of the project, starting from a quiz to a choose your own adventure project
* Struggling with figuring out the Tkinter interface
* Attempting to add images onto the interface with Pillow

Goals: 
* Adding images to the project
* Adding more paths
